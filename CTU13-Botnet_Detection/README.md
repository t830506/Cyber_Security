# CTU13-Botnet_Detection
使用知名的資料集CTU-13，它是2011年捷克共和國CTU大學捕獲的殭屍網絡流量的數據集。大量捕獲與正常流量和背景流量混合的真實殭屍網絡流量，其中包含十三種殭屍網絡樣本的捕獲，為有標記的數據集。因為殭屍與IP位置有關連，我們利用「卷積神經網絡」的概念，先將每一組IP配對組合取出，當作一張圖片做輸入；或是用「遞歸神經網絡」的概念，將一個時段內的流量做排名，並替IP找代理人，以利之後出現過未知的IP仍然可以做預測，然後依照時間先後排序當作輸入。利用各種的前處理技巧之後，反覆調整類神經網路模型的參數、深度和寬度，建立適當的模型找出殭屍網路，最後利用混淆矩陣查看偽陽性和偽陰性的數量，發現類神經網路可以有效找到殭屍網路的行為模式，得以成功做辨識和預測。
# Dataset
The Stratosphere IPS Project has a sister project called the Malware Capture Facility Project that is responsible for making the long-term captures. This project is continually obtaining malware and normal data to feed the Stratosphere IPS.

# Why we capture Normal Data
Machine learning algorithms need to be verified to find out their precise performance in real data. Specially in network computer security it is really important to have good datasets, because the data in the networks is infinite, changing, varied and with a high concept drift. These issues force us to obtain good datasets to train, verify and test the algorithms.

To make a good verification we need three types of traffic: Malware, Normal and Background. The Malware traffic will include all the things we want to detect, specially C&C (Command and Control) connections. The Normal traffic is very important to find out the real performance of our algorithms by computing the False Positives and True Negatives. The Background traffic is necessary to saturate the algorithms, verify its memory/speed performance and to test if the algorithm gets confused with the data.

# Special Dataset CTU-13
The CTU-13 dataset consist in a group of 13 different malware captures done in a real network environment. The captures include Botnet, Normal and Background traffic. The Botnet traffic comes from the infected hosts, the Normal traffic from the verified normal hosts and the Background traffic is all the rest of traffic that we don’t know what it is for sure. The dataset is labeled in a flow by flow basis, consisting in one of the largest and more labeled botnet datasets available. The files that can be downloaded are:

## Binetflow files
1. For Botnet, Normal and Background traffic.
2. Text files with bidirectional flows generated by Argus.
## Biargus files
1. For Botnet, Normal and Background traffic.
2. Binary files with bidirectional flows generated by Argus.
## Complete Pcap files
1. For Botnet traffic.
2. Pcap files with all the payload data.
## Truncated Pcap files
1. For Botnet, Normal and Background traffic.
2. Pcap files only with the headers information.
